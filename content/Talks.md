## Talks

### Querying Data in yt - Domain Stories and Workflows
*Presented on December 11, 2020 at the 2020 RHytHM Event*

I talk about the domain stories in depth with a focus on yt applications at the [RHytHM: ResearcH using yt Highlights Meeting](https://indico.flatironinstitute.org/event/722/overview).

Check out the [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QJJ5XxYBYsjApxQgqt9XjDg5lbG99yNsabB6Av-BgTA/edit?usp=sharing).

### Building a Sustainable Domain Knowledge Framework for Natural Science Software Tools
*Presented on April 1st, 2020 at the 2020 What is Information Conference*

I presented on the findings from three domain stories of users implementing yt for astrophysics analysis at the [What is Information](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/whatistechnology/) conference online.

Check out the [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YbnAes_HFx2oVoTps_1qY1Xf182Emc4fIiS6isWXkJM/edit?usp=sharing).

### A Grammar of Volumetric Analysis
*Presented on Oct 30, 2019 at the 2019 iSchool Research Showcase*

Dr. Turk and I outline our work on developing a grammar to describe scientific analysis and visualization based on the yt project at the [iSchool Research Showcase](https://ischool.illinois.edu/research/showcase/2019-showcase).
