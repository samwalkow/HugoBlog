I am a PhD student in Informatics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I work with [Dr. Matthew Turk](https://matthewturk.github.io/#about) in the [Data Exploration Lab](https://data-exp-lab.github.io/) where we pursue research on open source scientific software development, data visualization and analytics, and software in education.

I am interested in understanding how users think about data, and how that internal representation of data changes as it is combined with scientific software to address research questions. I investigate this understanding by deconstructing user workflows, visualization, and analysis to illustrate the interaction between the user and the program.

Secondly, I am interested in how software and computer programming are used in an education setting, and how users interact with data and programming to learn how to code.

The aim of both of my research interests is to improve the development of open source software, but also to understand how that interaction affects the users cognition and shaping of future learning and research inquiry. I hope to reframe working with software tools as a network of shared knowledge where information is passed back and forth between person and machine.
