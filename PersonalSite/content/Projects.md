#### Mozilla Open Leaders
January 2018 - April 2018

I was accepted into [Mozilla's Open Leaders Initiative](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/mozilla-open-leaders/) on the Culture track, where we did a collaborative deep dive on how to do open work. The interactive course portion was conducted online with participants from across the world. I also worked on a project that conducted data analysis on Github usage.

See the finished work [here](https://github.com/samwalkow/Diversity_and_Open_Source_Software_Sustainability).
